  abstract = "The impact of the gut microbiota in human health is affected by
              several factors including its composition, drug administrations,
              therapeutic interventions and underlying diseases. Unfortunately,
              many human microbiota datasets available publicly were collected
              to study the impact of single variables, and typically consist of
              outpatients in cross-sectional studies, have small sample numbers
              and/or lack metadata to account for confounders. These
              limitations can complicate reusing the data for questions outside
              their original focus. Here, we provide comprehensive longitudinal
              patient dataset that overcomes those limitations: a collection of
              fecal microbiota compositions (>10,000 microbiota samples from
              >1,000 patients) and a rich description of the ``hospitalome''
              experienced by the hosts, i.e., their drug exposures and other
              metadata from patients with cancer, hospitalized to receive
              allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) at a
              large cancer center in the United States. We present five
              examples of how to apply these data to address clinical and
              scientific questions on host-associated microbial communities.",

              (COVID-19) pandemic, our team hosted our first fully online
              workshop teaching the QIIME 2 microbiome bioinformatics platform.
              We had 75 enrolled participants who joined from at least 25
              different countries on 6 continents, and we had 22 instructors on
              4 continents. In the 5-day workshop, participants worked hands-on
              with a cloud-based shared compute cluster that we deployed for
              this course. The event was well received, and participants
              provided feedback and suggestions in a postworkshop
              questionnaire. In January of 2021, we followed this workshop with
              a second fully online workshop, incorporating lessons from the
              first. Here, we present details on the technology and protocols
              that we used to run these workshops, focusing on the first
              workshop and then introducing changes made for the second
              workshop. We discuss what worked well, what didn't work well, and
              what we plan to do differently in future workshops.",
